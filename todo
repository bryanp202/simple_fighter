[ ] Make direction cancel option for states use bitflags
    Ex. Crouch would just be down. Then anything with down would count (down, downback, downforward)

[ ] Make blocking be a option on states flag; AllowBlocking
    Ex. Allow blocking would mean if the character is hold back, normal block, downblock is low block
    This solves the problem of hit stun and blocking states. Blocking is still tied to state but no longer
    Requires transitions to update block type. Could also allow for left/right during hitstun block protection
    if i want it.

[ ] Add Special state for crouch blocking, and maybe crouch hitstun. Transition to crouch blocking if lowblock
    true and attack connects

[ ] Better matchmaking abort handling
